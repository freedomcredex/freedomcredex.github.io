Our mission: Level the playing field. Millions of Americans are not able to access money at a fair rate. For many, even
             if they are financially savvy and have solid budgeting and spending habits, they are unable to prove that
             to lenders because of the current unfair antequated credit system. We believe all Americans and immigrants
             in this country should have an equal opportunity to access money on their journey in pursuit of the American
             Dream.
                                                                            
Our philosopy: We offer the most competitive rates in the industry. We also offer our expert opinion if you ask on what
               tradlines we think would work best for you. As an exchange, we take one of the smallest cuts in the industry,
               while giving the best rates to both sides (supply = cardholders and demand = tradeline purchasers). One
               important factor that allows us to do this is handling all payments in cryptocurrency. Shoot us an email
               when you're ready to order, simply specifying (1) the tradeline ID # , (2) the necessary info for the
               authorized user you'd like added, and (3) whether you will be paying in USD Coin or Bitcoin. In less than 24
               hours, we'll get back to you with an address to send your crypto to. Once funds are received, the AU will be
               immediately added to the card within 48 hours. This means the process must start at least 72 hours prior to
               the card's statement closing date. So long as we receive payment 48 hours prior to the card closing date,
               we guarantee the AU will be added.
